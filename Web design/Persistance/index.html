        <h1><strong>Persistance</strong></h1>
        <p>
            Why is persistence important in life?
Persistence gives you vital experience. When you're persistent, 
you learn that each failure gives you another opportunity to learn.
 With each failure, you'll become more resilient. 
 You'll also learn how you can overcome any challenges

                <p>Someone who is persistent continues doing something or tries 
                    to do something in a determined but often unreasonable way: 
                    Be persistent - don't give up. He has been a persistent critic of the president.</p>

                        <p>The plan is to start where you are right now and improve gradually â€“ building the capacity to take on bigger challenges. 
                        You see, a big dream is more like a journey than a task.
                         If you can commit yourself to continuously developing yourself and increasing your strength, you are ready to go.</p>
